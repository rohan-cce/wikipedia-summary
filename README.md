Now a days it has become quite common for us to search for some information in web rather than just searching for the books related to our search. But when you are in an urgent need to get for some information,Will you be patient in reading those big paragraphs from Wikipedia?Ofcourse it is not possible at that time because you would be in hurry to get for an information that is small and delivers all the information needed.Let me expain it with an example,If you are asked to play a game that is, to search for a definition of a word  and your given 1 minute for it.Will you be searching for the full definition in those long paragraphs of Wikipedia ?No right?So we have come up with a project in python which summarizes those long paragraphs of Wikipedia into an understandable shorter one.Even if you are in a need to gather a very less information about many stuffs,this would be a greater advantageous one for you.This would also be highly beneficial and helpful one to get a particular and needed information. And this is all about our  project.So is it enough to say that we did a project? Don't you want to look on our code?Not a big work just scroll down,

1) In the first line of our code ,we have used "tkinter", which is for a fast and easy way to create GUI applications.
2)In the next line we are importing wikipedia.Before you import make sure that you have installed the module using, pip install wikipedia in your command prompt.Wikipedia is a Python library that makes an easy access to get data from Wikipedia.
3)In the next part of the code we are getting the text written inside the widget.
4)The next line is used to insert the specified string at the given index.
5)The next line is absolutely to create a root window.
6)The next line is to implement a display box.
7)In the next line the Pack geometry manager packs widgets in row or columns.
8)In the next line the button widget adds button to the application.
9)In the next line pack geometry manager packs widgets in rows or columns.
10)The next  part is that ,The text widget provides formatted text display and pack geometry manager packs widgets in rows or columns.
